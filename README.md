# A Prosemirror starter app

### Why?

From the ProseMirror project owner/docs:

> The fact that ProseMirror isn't distributed as a single, browser-loadable script means that you'll probably want to use some kind of bundler when using it. A bundler is a tool that automatically finds your script's dependencies, and combines them into a single big file that you can easily load from a web page.

He is being kind. You will **have** to use a bundler, so let's save a bit of time, not debate which bundler is best, and just offer a simple, minimal starter-app implementing the Prosemirror repo _prosemirror-example-setup_ with the Javacript bundler **RollUp**. (Webpackers, see _Notes_ below.)

This is purely a demonstration project that combines the common conventions and **rollup.config.js** file from the _rollup-starter-app_ repo with the modules located in the repo _prosemirror-example-setup_.

It is NOT a production grade implementation. Please say that aloud. And again, once more.

### Use

1. Clone the repo. ```git clone git@github.com:turigeza/prosemirror-starter-app.git```
2. Install the dependencies. ```npm install```
3. Run the 'dev' script from package-json ( ```npm run dev```).
4. Inspect the app in a browser at ```localhost:5000```.

### Notes

This point of this project is merely to document how to get up and running with a minimal editor with RollUp. It is not production-worthy.

Additionally, this project is not affiliated with Prosemirror; he can change things and we will never be informed. That is how it should be, right?

If you prefer to use **Webpack** for bundling, another dev (not me) offers this repo:

**Vue.js** lovers might be interested in this one:

Prosemirror is not another jquery plugin or drop-in widget. Instead it is thoughtful take on the problems inherent in the lame HTML attribute ```contenteditable```. In other words, read the project docs.
